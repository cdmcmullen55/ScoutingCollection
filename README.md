# ScoutingCollection

This application runs on [Xamarin.Forms](https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/xamarin-forms/getting-started/), a cross-platform framework that uses C# and XAML to develop mobile applications. The above link should be enough to get started; it has the basics of the App Lifecycle, MVVM (model-view-viewmodel), Data Bindings, and XAML elements and syntax. More detailed information can be found in [Creating Mobile Apps with Xamarin.Forms](https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/xamarin-forms/creating-mobile-apps-xamarin-forms/), which Microsoft generously provides for free. I recommend chapters 1, 2, 7, 16, and 18 to cover the absolute basics. 

Xamarin.Forms assumes familiarity with C#, which I know a lot of FRC members don't necessarily have. Luckily, it's incredibly similar to Java, which as a general rule FRC coders will have at least some experience with. This code is best tested using Visual Studio on PC and Xamarin Studio on Mac.

Topics of interest:
* MVVM
  * What is a ViewModel?
  * Passing data
* The OnPropertyChanged Event Handler
* Data Bindings
* UI Layout options
